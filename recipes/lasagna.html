        <h2>Mmmmmm, Lasagna</h2>
        <p>According to Brenda - who I assume created this recipe - "This is a faster, and less expensive lasagna."  From the picture, it looks
            like a very homestyle type of lasagna. </p>
        <p>Thank you Brenda for all you have done for the world of lasagna.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 pound shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 pound shredded cheddar chesse</li>
            <li>1 pint ricotta cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown beef and season with salt and pepper; drain. 
                Stir in spaghetti sauce and garlic and simmer 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine mozzarella, Cheddar and ricotta; stir well. In 9x13 inch pan, alternate layers of noodles, meat mixture and 
                cheese mixture until pan is filled.</li>
